# GSAP Projects 🚀

This repository is a personal playground where I experiment and learn **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** — a powerful JavaScript animation library.  
From smooth transitions to complex scroll-based animations, you’ll find a variety of creative examples here.

## 📂 Project Structure
Each project is organized in its own folder, containing:
- `index.html` → The HTML structure
- `style.css` → Styling for the project
- `script.js` → GSAP animations

Example:
```bash
GSAP/
│── project-1/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
│── project-2/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
└── README.md
```
